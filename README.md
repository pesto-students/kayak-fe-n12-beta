# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- [Fetch Api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/)
- [Airbnb Eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb)
- [Preetier](https://prettier.io/)
